#horiseonaccessible
Hello!
This is my first README file for this Horiseon website.
I have added alt text to each image such that any person with vision diability may view the image contents through an internet reader application.
I also recognize that certain CSS elements and classes have the same styling applied so I want to consolidate those. I also added comments to the css elements. Both for easier readibility for the next person who works on this website. 
I also fixed the search engine optimization element with an id element so that clicking the search engine optimization text next to the right of the header will take the user to the appropriate part of the page.
This website is for the company Horiseon, a branding company that can help clients market themselves on the internet. Information provided.
