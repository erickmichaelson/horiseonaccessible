#horiseonaccessible
Hello!
This is my first README file for this Horiseon website.
I have added alt text to each image such that any person with vision diability may view the image contents through an internet reader application.
I also recognize that certain CSS elements and classes have the same styling applied so I want to consolidate those for easier readibility for the next person who works on this website.
